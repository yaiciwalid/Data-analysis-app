![interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ca3b862-95df-4233-895c-e01e6e354f8e)

## Description

A comprehensive data analysis platform that enables users to import data, transform it to prepare it for machine learning algorithms, perform univariate and bivariate analysis, and train and test machine learning models.

## Features

* **Data Import**: Import data from various sources, including CSV, Excel, and databases.
* **Data Transformation**: Transform and preprocess data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
* **Univariate Analysis**: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables.
* **Bivariate Analysis**: Perform bivariate analysis to understand the relationships between pairs of variables.
* **Machine Learning**: Train and test machine learning models using various algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and more.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Dash
* Pandas
* Plotly
* Scikit-learn
